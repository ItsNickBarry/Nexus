# Welcome to the configuration file of the Nexus plugin !
######
# It is recommended that only the half-life variables be changed.
# The other variables are interdependent and may have adverse interactions if modified incorrectly.
############d

###
# Power Points Half-Life: the half-life of a Nexus's power points.
###
# double (decimal): -infinity < powerPointsHalfLife < infinity
# Values greater than 0 determine the amount of time, in days, that it takes for the number of each Nexus's power points to halve.
# Values less than 0 determine the amount of time, in days, that it takes for the number of each Nexus's power points to double.
# A value of 0 causes a Nexus's power points to remain constant with respect to time, unless modified by player actions.
# default: 10, recommended: 5-100
powerPointsHalfLife: -.005

###
# Spread Points Half-Life: the half-life of a Nexus's spread points.
###
# double (decimal): -infinity < spreadPointsHalfLife < infinity
# Values greater than 0 determine the amount of time, in days, that it takes for the number of each Nexus's spread points to halve.
# Values less than 0 determine the amount of time, in days, that it takes for the number of each Nexus's spread points to double.
# A value of 0 causes a Nexus's spread points to remain constant with respect to time, unless modified by player actions.
# default: 20, recommended: 5-100
spreadPointsHalfLife: 20

# It is not recommended to edit the following variables without an understanding of the plugin source code.
# Find the source code at https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/Nexus
############

###
# Power Level Factor: how quickly a Nexus's accumulation of power points will increase the power level
###
# integer: 0 < powerLevelFactor
# A greater value causes fewer power points to be required to increase a Nexus's power level.
# A lesser value causes more power points to be required to increase a Nexus's power level.
# default: 100, recommended: 50-500
powerLevelFactor: 100

###
# Power Points Base: the number of power points allotted to newly created Nexus
###
# integer: powerPointsMin < powerPointsBase
# A greater value relative to powerPointsMin allows more time before a new, unmaintained Nexus will be destroyed.
# default: 100, recommended: ~1.5 * powerPointsMin
powerPointsBase: 100

###
# Power Points Min: the minimum number of power points required for a Nexus to continue existence
###
# integer: 0 <= powerPointsMin < powerPointsBase
# A value of 0 allows that Nexus will not be destroyed as a result of decay of power points.
# default: 75, recommended: ~.75 * powerPointsBase
powerPointsMin: 75

###
# Spread Level Factor: how quickly a Nexus's accumulation of spread points will increase the spread level.
###
# double (decimal): 0 <= spreadLevelFactor
# A greater value causes a lower number of spread points to be required to increase a Nexus's spread close to its maximum.
# A lesser value causes a higher number of spread points to be required to increase a Nexus's spread close to its maximum.
# A value of 0 causes spread points to have no effect on the spread of a Nexus.
# default: .01, recommended: .01-.1
spreadLevelFactor: .01

###
# Spread Level Variability: the total variability of a Nexus's spread, with respect to the normalized spread value, given an arbitrarily high or low number of spread points
###
# double (decimal): 0 <= spreadLevelVariability <=1
# A value of 1 causes a Nexus's spread to fluctuate by +/- up to 100%, depending on spread points.
# A value of 0 causes spread points to have no effect on the spread of a Nexus.
# default: 1, recommended: 0-1
spreadLevelVariabliity: 1

###
# Use Spheres: whether the area influenced by a Nexus is a sphere, rather than a cylinder.
###
# boolean: true or false
# A value of true causes Nexus regions to be spherical; spherical regions have the same horizontal radius as cylindrical regions, but do not necessarily extend to the top or bottom of the world, allowing unrestricted access, including placement of new Nexus, above and below some protected blocks.
# A value of false causes Nexus regions to be cylindrical, extending to the top and bottom of the world.
# default: false, recommended: false
useSpheres: false
